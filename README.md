- 👋 Hi, I’m @shnitko2
👀 I’m interested in the world of design and visual communication, creating meaningful and engaging experiences through artistic expression.

🌱 I’m currently learning about user-centered design principles and honing my skills in graphic design software.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design projects that encompass branding, digital interfaces, and print materials to evoke emotions and deliver impactful messages.
